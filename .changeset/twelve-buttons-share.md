- In the Disputes Overview component, we added a tooltip to help users easily identify disputes expiring in less than 10 days.
- In the Transaction components, we introduced internal analytics tracking to help us understand user interactions and improve future releases.
- We now fetch static assets such as images and translations from a CDN (Content Delivery Network), which improves the loading speed and overall performance across all components.
