- In the Disputes Management component, we expanded the “Defend” option, to simplify handling RFIs and chargebacks. In addition to Mastercard and Visa, you can now defend disputes from additional payment methods, including Discover, American Express, Pulse, and Klarna. As a result, we now support 100% of defendable disputes affiliated with all these supported payment methods.
- Across all components, we updated error message styling so text that can be copied no longer appears as a clickable link.
- In the Transactions Overview component, Firefox number fields now accept numeric digits only.
