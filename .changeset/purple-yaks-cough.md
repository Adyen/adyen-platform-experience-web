This release introduces two new components: **CapitalOverview** and **CapitalOffer**. These components will enable you to integrate all the features required to offer business financing (also called a grant) in your user interface with minimal engineering effort.

The **Capital Overview** component enables users to:

-   View messages indicating their eligibility to receive a grant.
-   Sign the Terms of Service required to secure a grant from Adyen.
-   Check the current status of their grant.
-   Access the term sheet for detailed information about the active grant, such as the repayment threshold, repayment period, fees, the amount already repaid, and the remaining amount.
-   Track their repayment progress.

The **Capital Offer** component enables user to:

-   Select a grant amount within their qualifying limit using a dynamic slider.
-   View a preliminary term sheet of the selected grant offer, such as the repayment threshold, repayment period, and fees.
-   Apply for a grant.

**By default, the Capital Overview component includes the Capital Offer component, which together provide the complete flow.**
