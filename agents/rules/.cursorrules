# Testing Guidelines

When writing unit tests, always follow the guidelines in:

- `docs/testing/unit-tests/testing-guidelines-general.md` - Core principles and workflow
- `docs/testing/unit-tests/testing-guidelines-hooks.md` - For custom Preact hooks
- `docs/testing/unit-tests/testing-guidelines-components.md` - For Preact components

## Quick Reference

### Before Writing Tests

1. Read the appropriate guideline file based on what you're testing
2. For hooks: Complete analysis phase and wait for confirmation
3. Use deterministic assertions only (no `typeof`, `toMatch`, `toContain`)
